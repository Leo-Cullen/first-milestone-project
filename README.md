### Coyne engineering

## Overview

'Coyne' is a website for a small business owner. Lee Coyne has returned to work in Ireland after 
a couple of decades working in the UK as a structural engineer. As part of establishing himself
as a self-employed surveyor, he wants a website to advertise his services to potential clients.

# UX
This website is at property owners looking for a structural engineer in the West Cork area. Potential clients can read testimonials 
and view pictures of mr. Coyne's previous projects.

# User stories

As a user I will be looking for a surveyor for a small to medium sized project. I primarily want to be quickly able to find contact details. Secondly, I want to be able to find links to Mr. Coyne's social media sites (Facebook and LinkIn) in order to see if other clients are satisfied. Features such as a gallery and testimonials section are of lesser importance.  
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

# Features
navbar with mobile phone number and social media links.
Splash screen with a logo.
testimonials section with quotes from previous satisfied customers.
Gallery with images and short description of previous projects.
Contact section with contact details for Mr. Coyne.
Contact form.

Extending gallery section so that images open up in a modal or carousel

# Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Google fonts.

# Testing
All buttons, links and browser buttons clicked on. Two volunteers spent 10 mins navigating the site.
